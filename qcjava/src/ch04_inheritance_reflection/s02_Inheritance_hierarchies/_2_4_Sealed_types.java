 * @sealed_types: unless a class is declared final, anyone can form a subclass of it. What if u want to have more control?
 * @ex: suppose u feel the need to write your own JSON library because none of the ones out there do exactly what u need
 * @JSON_standard: says that a JSON value is an array, number, string, Boolean value, object, or null.
 * @approach: is to model this with classes JSONArray, JSONNumber, and so on that extend an abstract class JSONValue
 * @see ch04_inheritance_reflection.s02_Inheritance_hierarchies.JSONValue
